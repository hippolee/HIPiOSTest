 * Returns the associated mechanism name.

 *       <mechanism>DIGEST-MD5</mechanism>
 *       <mechanism>X-FACEBOOK-PLATFORM</mechanism>
 *       <mechanism>X-YOUR-CUSTOM-AUTH-SCHEME</mechanism>

 * The mechanismName returned should match the value inside the <mechanism>HERE</mechanism>.

/**
 * Standard init method.
 *
 * The JUMPStream class natively supports the standard authentication scheme (auth with password).
 * If that method is used, then jumpStream will automatically create an authentication instance via this method.
 * Which authentication class it chooses is based on the configured authentication priorities,
 * and the auth mechanisms supported by the server.
 *
 * Not all authentication mechanisms will use this init method.
 * For example:
 *  - they require an appId and authToken
 *  - they require a userName (not related to JID), privilegeLevel, and password
 *  - they require an eyeScan and voiceFingerprint
 *
 * In this case, the authentication mechanism class should provide it's own custom init method.
 * However it should still implement this method, and then use the start method to notify of errors.

 * For example: "X-Custom-Platform authentication requires authToken"
