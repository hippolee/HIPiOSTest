 * Note that this may be different from the virtual jump hostname.
 * Just as HTTP servers can support mulitple virtual hosts from a single server, so too can jump servers.
 * A prime example is google via google apps.
 *
 * For example, say you own the domain "mydomain.com".

 * So if somebody sends you an email, it actually goes to google's servers, where you later access it from.
 * Similarly, you connect to google's servers to sign into jump.
 *
 * In the example above, your hostname is "talk.google.com" and your JID is "me@mydomain.com".
 *
 * This hostName property is optional.
 * If you do not set the hostName, then the framework will follow the jump specification using jid's domain.
