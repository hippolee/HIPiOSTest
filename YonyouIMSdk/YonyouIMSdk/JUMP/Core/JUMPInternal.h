/**
 * It is recommended that storage classes cache a stream's myJID.
 * This prevents them from constantly querying the property from the jumpStream instance,
 * as doing so goes through jumpStream's dispatch queue.
 * Caching the stream's myJID frees the dispatch queue to handle jump processing tasks.
 *
 * The object of the notification will be the JUMPStream instance.
 *
 * Note: We're not using the typical MulticastDelegate paradigm for this task as
 * storage classes are not typically added as a delegate of the jumpStream.

/**
 * JUMPStream maintains thread safety by dispatching  through the internal serial jumpQueue.
 * Subclasses of JUMPStream MUST follow the same technique:
 *
 * dispatch_block_t block = ^{
 *     // Code goes here
 * };
 *
 * if (dispatch_get_specific(jumpQueueTag))
 *   block();
 * else
 *   dispatch_sync(jumpQueue, block);
 *
 * Category methods may or may not need to dispatch through the jumpQueue.
 * It depends entirely on what properties of jumpStream the category method needs to access.
 * For example, if a category only accesses a single property, such as the rootPacket,
 * then it can simply fetch the atomic property, inspect it, and complete its job.
 * However, if the category needs to fetch multiple properties, then it likely needs to fetch all such
 * properties in an atomic fashion. In this case, the category should likely go through the jumpQueue,
 * to ensure that it gets an atomic state of the jumpStream in order to complete its job.
